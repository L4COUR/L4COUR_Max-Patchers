# Max4Live-Jitter-Visualizer-patch
In this project my goal was to do a live performance without the use of presets from Ableton’s core lib

rary or any sort of VST’s. Instead i wanted to see, what I could achieve with the technics and methods I have learned from Engelsholm Højskole regarding: composing, sound-design and mixing. Another element i research, during this project, was how to program a Max patch, more specifically jitter elements, with OpenGL, as a visual representation of sound. The live perfo

rmance would what as a result of the visual programming give the audience a 1:1 experience, between my interaktion with the MIDI-controllers in relation to sound and visuals.

Vision: “A live performance with the Push controller, of a minimalistic character, and visuals that reacts accordingly to live sound, in a black and white format. Live

Performance composed in Ableton live, and audio-visuals programmed in Max for live via jitter and OpenGL.

**Materials required:**

Computer (Ableton live, Max for live, and OpenGL)
Projector
white canvas
Speaker setup
MIDI (Push, Launchcontrol, Launchpad)
Cabling (USB, Power supply..)
Soundcard

**The two dogma's:**

- The music cannot contain elements with presets
- Visuals must be programmed using Max for live

Time schedule:

**week 21 – 27:**
Max4live, OpenGL programming of visuals, and ideers for the track

**week 28 – 04:**
completion of visual programming, start of track composition and live MIDI-mapping

**week 05 – 11:**
completion of track composition and MIDI-mapping, practice the performance, and trying out the visuals with the projector on the white canvas.
