This project was a part of my semester at Engelsholm's electronic music course, which i attended in the fall 2016. The idea was to do a live performance without the use of presets from Ableton’s core library or any other form of plugin VST’s. Instead I wanted use the technics and methods I had learned in relation to: composing, sound-design and mixing. Another element I researched during the project, was how to program a Max patch, containing jitter elements with OpenGL, which would be used as a visual representation of the live sound. The live performance along with the visual programming, would in turn give the audience a 1:1 experience between the interaktion between the performer, MIDI-controllers and the sound conjoured from these interactions would then be represented with the jitter audio-visuals patch.

**Vision:** 

A live performance with the Push controller, of a minimalistic character, and visuals that reacts accordingly to live sound, in a black and white format. Live Performance composed in Ableton live, and audio-visuals programmed in Max for live via jitter and OpenGL.

**Materials required:**

Computer (Ableton live, Max for live, and OpenGL)
Projector
white canvas
Speaker setup
MIDI (Push, Launchcontrol, Launchpad)
Cabling (USB, Power supply..)
Soundcard

**The two dogma's:**

- The music cannot contain elements with presets
- Visuals must be programmed using Max for live

Time schedule:

**Week 21 – 27:**
Max4live, OpenGL programming of visuals, and ideers for the track

**Week 28 – 04:**
completion of visual programming, start of track composition and live MIDI-mapping

**Week 05 – 11:**
completion of track composition and MIDI-mapping, practice the performance, and trying out the visuals with the projector on the white canvas.
