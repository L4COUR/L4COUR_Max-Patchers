The main inspiration for Literal Pong was the [analog computer ping pong game](https://youtu.be/OliX78mgfbE?t=764) at the Medie Archeologische Fundus (MAF) at the Humboldt University.

You could argue that programming the game of ping pong using MaxMSP is a tedious and unefficient endavour, not unlike programming "tennis for two" on an analog computer.
